# Personal Awesome List
Github has a lot of 'awesome lists'. Here's mine.

[ZoomIt](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/zoomit) - Presenting something at work but people can't read something? Zoom in with ZoomIt. Also supports drawing and more.

[ShareX](https://getsharex.com/) - Screen capture software. Regions, video, gifs. Very customizable.

[FARR](https://www.donationcoder.com/software/mouser/popular-apps/farr) - A launcher that is very cutomizable. Does not index files, uses heuristics
