# 'Awesome' List
Github has a lot of 'awesome lists'. Here's mine.

## Software

[ZoomIt](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/zoomit) - Presenting something at work but people can't read something? Zoom in with ZoomIt. Also supports drawing and more.

[ShareX](https://getsharex.com/) - Screen capture software. Regions, video, gifs. Very customizable.

[FARR](https://www.donationcoder.com/software/mouser/popular-apps/farr) - A launcher that is very cutomizable. Does not index files, uses heuristics

[AutoHotkey](https://autohotkey.com/) - "The ultimate automation scripting language for Windows."

[ERD Plus](https://erdplus.com/#/standalone) - Need to mock up a simple entity relationship diagram quickly? 

[Draw IO](https://www.draw.io/) - Don't have Visio? Would it be overkill if you had it? Just don't like Visio? Check out draw.io

## Data

[US States](https://github.com/click-here/Awesome/blob/master/Data/50states.txt) - Sometimes you just need a clean list of the 50 states.
